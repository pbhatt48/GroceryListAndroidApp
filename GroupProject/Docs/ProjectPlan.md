## 1 Introduction

GroceryListManager application helps users to manage their grocery lists by providing various user-based functionality to customize and edit their grocery lists. 

## 2 Process Description

Since we have a well-defined project with specific requirements, we decided to choose waterfall software development process. 

### a) Software Concept:
- *Activity description:*
	At this phase, the detail document of a software description will be created. Different UI prototypes will be conducted to highlight the use case and requirements of the software. The need of GroceryListManager software is realized and the customers with the product details will be approaching us for project initiation. Since the software specifications document handed to us will have well detailed requirements with all of its use case, behavior and functionalities, we plan on not spending time on this phase.

- *Entrance criteria:*
	The customers must have the concept/idea on software product’s functionalities, definitions and specifications. The need of software must be realized.

- *Exit criteria:*
	The customer must provide us the document detailing all the information, and specifications of the product. 

### b) Requirement Analysis:
- *Activity description:*
	At this development stage, all the requirements of the software product will be captured. This document will have all the pertaining information regarding the software, its behavior and specifications. All the brainstorming activities will be performed to get the detail requirements at this phase. The customer will provide us the list of the well-defined requirements. Hence our team does not plan on spending time on requirement analysis phase. However we as a team will go through each of the requirements and try to clear each other on the requirements before moving to design stage.

- *Entrance criteria:*
	To enter this stage, the software concept document must be completed and it must be handed over to the engineers. 

- *Exit criteria:*
	All of the requirements, specifications, and use cases are captured at this phase. Because we are implementing a waterfall process, any changes after this phase are harder and expensive to change. The document listed with requirements must be provided as a part of this process.


### c) Architectural Design:
- *Activity description:*
	At this phase, developers will go over the requirements and co-ordinate with customers to further clarify on software’s requirements and its specifications. Any unclear specifications will be discussed and the missing pieces will be determined. Our team plans on discussing the requirements and will come up with individual UML diagrams for the requirements. Then we will review each of our UML diagrams to list the pros and cons of each design and model.  

- *Entrance criteria:*
	To enter this stage, the detail requirement document must be completed and requirement engineers must hand it over to the developers. Our team must be provided with requirement document listing the specifications and requirements of the software. 

- *Exit criteria:*
	Developers and customers must have the design diagram ready before exiting this phase. Both the customers and developers must be satisfied with the design diagram.  We as a team will create our individual UML diagrams and pass it to each individual team members to identify the strong and weak points of each model before moving to another development phase.



### d) Detail Design:
- *Activity description:*
	At this phase, developers and customers will revisit again to talk about further questions on design implementation. Any missing part or the confusing details will be discussed and they will be included on the design part. Our team plans on revisiting each of the team member’s diagrams and will pick on one design that makes more sense for all of us.  We will also add some of the missing information if it was not mentioned on the selected design.

- *Entrance criteria:*
	To enter this stage, the architectural design document must be completed and it must be handed over to the developers. All our individual design diagrams are critiqued before entering this phase.

- *Exit criteria:*
	Developer and customers must agree upon the design details before preceding any further. At this point the customers and the developers must have a real idea on how system should behave, what functionalities it should provide and what should be implemented. Our team should pick one final design diagram that fits all our individuals model. 

### e) Coding and Debugging :
- *Activity description:*
	At this stage, developers will start programming to build the system that was designed at the previous phase. Multiple developers will work on different components of the software and will perform unit testing on each of their components. All the coding, debugging and the unit testing will be done at this stage. We as a team will be contributing individually on multiple components of the development, debugging and unit testing of the application.

- *Entrance criteria:*
	 The detail design document must be completed before we proceed any further on the implementation part.

- *Exit criteria:*
	All the developers must complete their preliminary development work for each component. Each development component must compile and unit testing should be completed successfully. Each component must provide the functionality as described on the design document. As developers we should be finishing development work and performing successful unit testing before we move to system testing.


### f) System Testing :
- *Activity description:*
	At this phase, all the components will be integrated and the integrated code will be passed to the testers to do the system testing. All the functional, non functional, performance testing, white box and black box testing will be done at this phase to check the specifications and behavior of the software. The QA testers from our team plan on doing these tasks to check the results as expected by the design. 

- *Entrance criteria:*
	All compiled, unit tested code from the developers must be completed before entering this stage.

- *Exit criteria:*
	All the integrated code from developers must pass the functional, non-functional, system integrated, performance, white box and black box testing before the release of the product. 


## 3 Team
Our team consists of four team members. They are as follows:

Team Name | Gtech ID | Email | Initials 
--------- | -------- | ----- | -------- 
Bujorel Tecu | btecu3 | btecu3@gatech.edu | BJ
Evan Stenger | estenger3 | estenger@umich.edu | ES
Prakash Bhatta | pbhatta3 | pbhatt48@gmail.com | PB
Sheng Jiang | sjiang3 | sheng.jiang@gatech.edu | SJ

People act as below roles on our team:

Project Manager:  Program manager are responsible for managing the project, resource and people to meet the deliverables of the project on time. They initiate the project and keep track of project in terms of time, scope and quality.

QA Engineer: QA Engineer performs different types of testing to check the specifications and functionalities of the software. They perform functional, non functional, performance, white box and black box testing to validate the software.

QA Lead: QA Lead designs on the planning and testing of the software. They lead the QA engineers to identify the bugs in the software and make sure the software that was delivered meet the right requirements as expected from customers.

Design Engineers: Design Engineers looks at the software requirements and designs the outlooks of software using various design documents. They look at the individual components of software and design the software depending upon how the interaction of each component takes place. 
 
Design Lead: Design Lead oversees the design of individual’s people and provides inputs and decisions on what design should be finalized.

Development Engineer: Development Engineer write code for individual component, make sure it compiles and perform unit test on their code. During the development, development engineers continuously check to see if their code matches with the design documents and requirements.

Development Engineer Lead: Development Engineer Lead oversees each individual’s work and provides guidance/feedback on each of theirs work. Lead is responsible for integrating all the individual component code. After integration, Development Engineer Lead will make sure the functionality and specification has been preserved and the best practice has been followed.
